# Enterprise Google Cloud VMware Engine Foundation (EGF) 

## GCVE Private Cloud with Cloud Monitoring using Standalone Agent

This blueprint creates a Google Cloud VMware Engine (GCVE) environment with a single private cloud and a single cluster. The private cloud is peered with a VPC network, and a monitoring VM with a standalone agent is deployed in the VPC network. The standalone agent captures and stores VMware metrics into Cloud Monitoring, and custom dashboards are created to visualize the metrics.


The diagram below depicts the architecture.

Components

*Google Cloud project*: The gcp project in which to create the resources.
*VPC network*: The VPC network to which the GCVE private cloud will be peered. Make sure Cloud NAT is already configured.
*GCVE private cloud*: The private cloud environment in GCVE.
*GCVE cluster*: The management-cluster in the private cloud.
*Network peering*: The peering connection between the VPC network and the GCVE private cloud.
*Monitoring VM*: The VM in the VPC network that runs the standalone agent.
*Standalone agent*: The gcve observability agent that collects VMware metrics and sends them to Cloud Monitoring.
*Cloud Monitoring*: The Google Cloud service that collects, stores, and visualizes monitoring data.
*Custom dashboards*: The dashboards that are created to visualize the VMware metrics.

## Running the blueprint

1. Clone this repository or [open it in cloud shell](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/enterprise-gcve-foundation&cloudshell_working_dir=blueprints%2Fsingle-vpc-lz), then go through the following steps to create resources:

2. Create `terraform.tfvars` variable file for terraform execution inputs. MOdify the variables in the new `terraform.tfvars` file.

    ```
    cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
    ```

3. Initialize and Apply the Terraform configuration

    ```
    terraform init && terraform apply -var-file terraform.tfvars
    ```

3. Monitor the deployment progress. The deployment may take around 2 hours to complete.
